# SVGnife
SVG preview, metadata reader and OpenClipart.org uploader in PHP-GTK

Warning! For now you have to manually set SVGnife.ini before first run. This version assumes that PHP-GTK is installed in c:\php-gtk\. It won't work well on Linux, probably (yet!). In next days everything should be fixed.
