# SVGnife
SVG preview, metadata reader and OpenClipart.org uploader in PHP-GTK

Warning! It's still in alpha version. 

For now you have to manually set SVGnife.ini before first run. This version assumes that PHP-GTK is installed in c:\php-gtk\. It won't work well on Linux, probably (yet!). In next days everything should be fixed. OC upload doesn't work yet!

The working directory have to be set to main directory and the file to run is `core\SVGnife.php`. You can run it via `run.bat`.

PHP-GTK downloads: http://gtk.php.net/download.php (use PHP 5.5/GTK+ 2.24.10 version or newer).
